# Employee Tracker

## Description

A CLI application using Node.Js, Inquirer and MySql. This application is a simple way for companies to keep track of their employees, departments, and roles. When you run the application, follow the propts for view information, adding, or updating information. 

## Installation

- This application requires node.js. Make sure this is installed on your computer first.
- Clone this repository to your computer. 
- Open the index.js file in your terminal and run ```npm install```. This will install all the dependancies to run this application.
- Update the .env.EXAMPLE file, change variables in it to show your information and remove the ".EXAMPLE" ending on the file name when ready to use. 
- Run the Schema file through MySQL to establish the database. I, personally, prefer doing this in the workbench. There is a provided "seeds" file to prepopulate the database, if desired.  

## Usage

- Once Inquirer is installed, run ```node index.js``` in the terminal and answer the prompts.
- All prompts will show in the terminal and need to be answered there.
